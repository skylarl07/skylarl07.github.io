					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>Hi, I'm a third-year undergraduate student pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Mathematics
						at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (or Virginia Tech). <br/>
						I am currently working as a research assistant for <a href="https://csgenome.org/">CSGenome</a>, 
						a research group under the Department of Computer Science, where I help testing and developing the database API, 
						and create SQLAlchemy models for incoming data. In addition, I'm working on a undergraduate research project related
						to data freshness. Besides that, I'm also a teaching assistant for the Department of 
						Mathematics, where I mainly help with multivariable calculus related courses. </br>
						I am passionate about many things related and not related to computer science, as you can see from the 
						<a href="pages/hobby.html">hobbies</a> section. I dream of becoming a video game developer, and create outstanding 
						games like one of my favorite of all time, the  <a href="https://www.unchartedthegame.com/en-us/">Uncharted</a> series.
